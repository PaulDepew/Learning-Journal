# What is Markdown?

###~~It is like HTML~~

[*Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.*](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

# There are many things you can do with markdown. Some examples are:

## Creating Headers by using a #
 > include more # in a row to designated sub-headers

## You can also emphasize text using a combination of  * or _ or strikethrough using ~~
> These can be used in any combination with eachother

## Insert Links using [] for the name followed by () for the URL
```[This is Google](www.google.com) ```
> you can also add titles to the pages by putting a quoted title in the url parantheses

```[This is Google](www.google.com "Google Home Page") ```

## If you are trying to paste code snippets, wrap the snippet in ``` ```

## Unordered lists are fairly simple, just provide a **-** or **+** in front of a line to put it into a list
> - 1st thing
> - 2nd thing
> - 3rd thing

## To order your list replace the - with a number (1,2,3 etc)

## Nested Lists become a little tricky...
> When creating a nested list you must line up the List indicator (-,+) under the first letter of the previous list item

## If you would like to insert an image, put a ! before a Link code to designate it as an image. 
``` ![Barack Obama](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/barack-obama.jpeg?w=800&quality=85)```

## You can also create task lists using - [x] or -[ ] 
> with an X placed in the brackets, the box will be checked. Without and the box will be empty

``` 
- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request
```
>These lists must be on seperate lines

# Personal Notes
 1. All codes must be seperated from other elements by either a space or full line
 2. Always check the files you are linking to, they might not be what you think they are
 3. Markdown can do a lot, but it can't do everything. If you can't do it in Markdown, find another language (like CSS)

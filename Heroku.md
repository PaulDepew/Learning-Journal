Deploy code to heroku
    - git push heroku master

Ensure and instance is running
    - heroku ps:scale web=1

Open the site

    - heroku logs --tail
    - cntrl+C stops the log streaming

Procfile:  A txt file in the root directory of your application to explicitly declare what command should execute your app
    web: node index.js
      ^declares the process: web

    - heroku ps checks how many dynos are running

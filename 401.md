## Solving Problems

Measure twice, cut once

Resist the urge to just start writing code

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

- 70% of your time should be spent on steps 1-3

#### Read the problem completely twice

You need to completely understand the problem before you can try to solve it. 
  - work through exmaples if they are given

Break it down manually first (Solve the problem using cake baking steps)
  - do optimization of the manual process

#### Pseudo-Code 

Psudeo-code for reversing a string.
```
// NewWord = “”

// Loop backwards through word to reverse

//   NewWord += CurrentLetter

// Return NewWord
```

#### Replace with real code
```js 
String newWord =""
for(int index = oldWord.Length – 1; index <= 0; index—)
   newWord += oldWord[index];
return newWord;
```

If you are having trouble here, you have not broken the problem down small enough yet. 

#### Optimize the code



## Act like you make $1000 an hour

“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

Are you busy or are you focused?

YOu teach people how to treat you. 
If you let people know your time is free and low valued, people will treat it as such.

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.


## How to think like a programmer

Have a framework and practice it!

- Understand
  - Know exactly what is being asked
  - doodle a diagram, write it down etc
- Plan
  - Plan your solution
    - 'Given input (x), what are the steps to return (y)?'
- Divide
  - Break it down into sub problems, then solve each sub problem one by one
- Stuck?
  - Debug your code step by step
  - Reassess your plan
  - Research your problem


## The 5 whys and hows

Developed by SAkichi Toyoda (founder of Toyota) in the 30s
'Go and See' Philosophy

1. Assemble the team
  - people familair with the specifics of the problem
2. Define the problem
  - Observe the problem in action
  - Discuss with the team and write a brief, clear problem statement
3. Ask the first WHY?
  - Why is the problem occuring?
4. Ask 4 more WHYs to delve deeper into the problem

[5 whys with multiple lanes](https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/5_Whys_Figure_2_multiple_lanes.jpg)

5. Know when to stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor your measures

## Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
  * So that you can run applications on a local machine or without a web connection. 

2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
  * A module is a group of packages. Packages are small aspects that make up a larger module, they are used to add on or seperate functions for cleaner code. 

3. What does the node package manager do?
  * It manages which modules are installed and used. It allows you to bring in other modules and publish your own to the node ecosystem. 

4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module
  ```js 
  module.exports = {
  getName: () => {
    return 'Jim';
  },

  getLocation: () => {
    return 'Munich';
  },

  dob: '12.01.1982',
};
  ``` 
  ```js
  const foo = require('./lib/foo');
  ```
  ```js
  exports.getFoo = () => {
    return 'foo';
  }
  ```

## Classes, Inheritance and Functional Programming

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  - Fast and Consistent Feedback!
  - Reduces time spent on reworking code
  - Makes you really think about the codebase

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  - It can help prep and clear test environments after or before each test. 

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - Lots of up-front work
  - Not a silver bullet, there can still be bugs
  - Its difficult to write good tests

4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  - Classes create a unique object and also make the variables implicitly 'this.'

6. Name a use case for a static method
  - providing a class specific method

7. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
  function foo(value, callback) {
    return callback(greeting) {
      console.log(greetin + value)
    }
  }

  foo(7, callback)(hello)

 A higher order function that utilizes a function as an argument or returns a function as an output.

## Data Modeling & NoSQL Databa

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
  - so that they can better create schema files and better visualize the data flow on the backend

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  - to create entries, read entries, update entries, and delete entries in a database. To modify or retrieve data from a database

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
  - Postgres is a SQL database whereas mongoDB is a noSQL database 

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
- An object data modeling lobrary from mongoDB and Node,js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation and is used to translate objects in code to objects in a mongoDB database

5. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
  - If you were creating a food order, You might have a User, Orders and Menu Items. A user would have a profile that would create and order from the menu items database.

## Advanced Mongo/Mongoose

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
  - Making a data model can help you better plan and organize your data structures as well as help you develop the different data points needed. It can also help inform a decision over whether or not to use SQL or NoSQL.

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  - To Create Data objects, to Read data objects, To Update data objects and to Delete data objects

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
  - Postrgres is an SQL and table based databse system. MongoDB is a NoSQL and JSON-like document based database system.

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
  - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling library which provides schema validation and provides object translation between code and mongoDB.

5. Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
  - They can handle increased traffic by simply adding more servers. 

6. Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
  - Because data is not relational, it is less safe from accidental mutation or deletion. Also, it is more prone to having data holes. 

7. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
  - On a pizza order, you would have a User, a pizza and toppings. The user would have user profile data and hold an object that would be the pizza. The pizza would have a list of pre-made pizzas or a custom made pizza object. The toppings would have an interior list and price as well as be added to the pizza based on the pizza object. 

8. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
  - MongoAtlas
  - DynamoDB
  - BigTable

## Linked Lists

What is a linked list? 
  - A sequence of Nodes that are connected to eachother. Each Node references the next Node in the link. 

What types of linked lists are there? 
  - Singly: Only one reference is linked into the next node
  - Doubly: A reference to both the next and previous linked nodes

A Node contains the data for each linked list
  - these should be as specific and compact as possible

Next:  A reference to the next node
Head: A reference to the first node
Current: The current node being looked at
  
  ![Linked List](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/images/LinkedList1.PNG)

CANNOT USE FOR LOOPS OR FOREACH METHODS
  - replaced with the Next value
  - traverse linked lists using while loops
    - allows you to check to see if the next node is not null (avoids errors)

``` 
		ALGORTIHM Includes (value)
		// INPUT <-- integer value
		// OUTPUT <-- boolean
			
			Current <-- Head

			WHILE Current is not NULL
				IF Current.Value is equal to value
					return TRUE

				Current <-- Current.Next

			return FALSE
```

1. Set the Current to the Head
  - guarantees we are starting from the beginning
2. create a while loop to check if the Current node is not null 
3. Check the value of the current node to the node we are looking for
  - returns true
4. Step 2-3 repeats until the end of the list is found
  - while loop breaks
5. If we hit the end, the value is not included and returns false

The Big O
  - time for INCLUDES would be O(n)
  - Space for INCLUDES would be O(1)

Add method for linked list - O(1)
```
  ALGORITHM Add(newNode)
		// INPUT <-- Node to add 
		// OUTPUT<-- No output

			Current <-- Head
			newNode.Next <-- Head
			Head <-- newNode
			Current <-- Head
```

Add method for linked list O(n)
```
ALGORITHM AddBefore(newNode, existingNode)
		// INPUT <-- New Node, Existing Node
		// OUTPUT <-- No Output

			Current <-- Head

			while Current.Next is not equal to NULL
				if Current.Next.Value is equal to existingNode.Value
					newNode.Next <-- existingNode
					Current.Next <-- newNode

				Current <-- Current.Next;		
```

Print out Nodes
```
ALGORITHM Print()
		// INPUT <-- None
		// OUTPUT <-- string to console

			Current <-- Head

			while Current.Next is not equal to NULL
				OUTPUT <-- "Current.Value --> "
				Current <-- Current.Next

			OUTPUT <-- "Current.Value --> NULL"
```

- Tip: When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.

- Tip: When making a Linked List, you may want to require that at least one node gets passed in upon instantiation. This first node is what your Head and Current will point too.

## HTTP and REST

Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol
  - A stateless request-response application layer.
  - Build distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
    - typically serves .html, .json, .xml and binary executables


#### HTTP Request

|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|GET|	No|	Yes|	Yes	|Yes|	Yes	|Retrieve a resource
|HEAD|	No|	No|	Yes|	Yes	|Yes	|Like GET but headers only
|POST|	Yes	|Yes|	No|	No|	Yes|	Create a resource
|PUT	|Yes|	Yes|	No|	Yes|	No	|Update a resource
|DELETE|	No|	Yes|	No|	Yes	|No|	Delete a resource
|CONNECT	|Yes	|Yes|	No|	No|	No	|Create TCP/IP tunnel

```

### REST
  - REpresentational State Transfer


- RESTful Endpoint: http://api.server.com/api/v1/people
  - http:// - Protocol/Scheme
  - api.server.com - Domain or Server
  - /api/v1 - API Endpoint
  - /people - The resource (This identifies a collection: all people)
  - /people/12345 - A more specific resource: The person with id 1234

  #### CRUD vs REST Method

 | REST Method	|CRUD Operation|	Function|
 |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|GET	|READ	|Retrieve 1 or More Records
|POST|	CREATE|	Create a new record
|PUT|	UPDATE	|Update a record through replacement (Put it back)
|PATCH	|UPDATE|	Update a record (just the parts that changed)
|DESTROY|	DELETE|	Remove a record

RESTful servers return JSON formatted Data

## Solving Problems

Measure twice, cut once

Resist the urge to just start writing code

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

- 70% of your time should be spent on steps 1-3

#### Read the problem completely twice

You need to completely understand the problem before you can try to solve it. 
  - work through exmaples if they are given

Break it down manually first (Solve the problem using cake baking steps)
  - do optimization of the manual process

#### Pseudo-Code 

Psudeo-code for reversing a string.
```
// NewWord = “”

// Loop backwards through word to reverse

//   NewWord += CurrentLetter

// Return NewWord
```

#### Replace with real code
```js 
String newWord =""
for(int index = oldWord.Length – 1; index <= 0; index—)
   newWord += oldWord[index];
return newWord;
```

If you are having trouble here, you have not broken the problem down small enough yet. 

#### Optimize the code



## Act like you make $1000 an hour

“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

Are you busy or are you focused?

YOu teach people how to treat you. 
If you let people know your time is free and low valued, people will treat it as such.

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.


## How to think like a programmer

Have a framework and practice it!

- Understand
  - Know exactly what is being asked
  - doodle a diagram, write it down etc
- Plan
  - Plan your solution
    - 'Given input (x), what are the steps to return (y)?'
- Divide
  - Break it down into sub problems, then solve each sub problem one by one
- Stuck?
  - Debug your code step by step
  - Reassess your plan
  - Research your problem


## The 5 whys and hows

Developed by SAkichi Toyoda (founder of Toyota) in the 30s
'Go and See' Philosophy

1. Assemble the team
  - people familair with the specifics of the problem
2. Define the problem
  - Observe the problem in action
  - Discuss with the team and write a brief, clear problem statement
3. Ask the first WHY?
  - Why is the problem occuring?
4. Ask 4 more WHYs to delve deeper into the problem

5. Know when to stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor your measures

## Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
  * So that you can run applications on a local machine or without a web connection. 

2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
  * A module is a group of packages. Packages are small aspects that make up a larger module, they are used to add on or seperate functions for cleaner code. 

3. What does the node package manager do?
  * It manages which modules are installed and used. It allows you to bring in other modules and publish your own to the node ecosystem. 

4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module
  ```js 
  module.exports = {
  getName: () => {
    return 'Jim';
  },

  getLocation: () => {
    return 'Munich';
  },

  dob: '12.01.1982',
};
  ``` 
  ```js
  const foo = require('./lib/foo');
  ```
  ```js
  exports.getFoo = () => {
    return 'foo';
  }
  ```

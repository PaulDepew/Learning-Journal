# Command Line:

> Bash: Born Again SHell (Shell = User interface)

> pwd: Print Working Directory; tells you current working directory

> ls: List; lists the files in a certain directory

> ls [Option] [Location]
	
> cd [Location]: Change Directory, without the location takes you to the home directory

> file [path]: tells you the file type of a file

> 'x' = file name that might have alternate characters

> Holiday\ Photos: nullify the special meaning of the next character

> Type a . in front of the directory name to make it "hidden"



### EVERYTHING IS A FILE!
### CASE SENSITIVE!

>Absolute vs Relative Path: Absolute Paths specify a location in relation to the root directory, always begin with a '/'. Relative Path specify a file or directory in relation to our current location. 

``` / = root 
~ = home directory
. = Current Directory
.. = Parent Directory
```


## Options:

> -a: Show hidden files in a directory

> -l: Long Listing 
	
    	- First character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d )
     	- Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory (we'll learn more about them in section 6).
    	- The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this).
    	- The next field is the owner of the file or directory (ryan in this case).
    	- The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case).
    	- Following this is the file size.
    	- Next up is the file modification time.
    	- Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory.

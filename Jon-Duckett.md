- ```<nav>``` = under header
- ```<article>``` = Replicable content piece
- ```<aside>``` = Relevant content to the main content
- ```<section>``` = A group of content
- ```<hgroup>``` = A group of header tags
- ```<figure <figcaption>``` = Content referenced in an article (images, videos, graphs, etc) 
- ```<div>' = alternative content block
- ```<footer>``` = Bottom of Page

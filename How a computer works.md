# Binary:

## 1 wire electricity signal can be either:  
 
| 1| 0|
|:---:|:---:|
|true|false|
|on | Off |
|yes | no |

Eacho position is  *2 to the left

More wires = larger numbers

wire | signal
|:---:|:----:|
1 | 1
8 |255
32 | 4 billion

###All things can be represetned by numbers! 

- Alphabet: assign a number to a letter

- Images: Pixel = Color can be defined as numbers

- Sound: Vibrations can be represented graphically, all wave points can be defnied by a number (more bits = more steps) 


# Circuits:

## Tiny Electronic components that relay binary

### Main Circuts

```->-``` *Not* Circuit: is the signal the same or not?

```=>-``` *And* Circuit: only if both of the cirtcuits are 1 

```=o=``` *Adder* Circuit: sums 2 bits
>put multiple of these side by side to add huge numbers

Smaller the circuit = less distance it has to go (speed of light is constant)

# What do computers do?

- Input Information
- Store Information
- Process Information
- Output Information

| Computer| Fucntion |
|:----:|:----|
| Input | Converts physical input into binary information |
| Memory | Stores Binary Information |
| CPU | Calculates Information |
|Output | Converts Information into physical output  | 

### Keyboard converts press to a binary
### CPU requests instructions from the memory on how to make the Key
### CPU runs instructions and stores in memory
### Memory is then sent to the screen
